    "Probability distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random event. In statistics, there are three main types of probability distributions: marginal, joint, and conditional. Each type describes a different aspect of the probability of a certain outcome or set of outcomes.\n",

We have such a dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juliotorniero/classic-rock-top-500-songs) and can load it into a pandas dataframe. Lets do an analysis on the year and probability of a certain genre being in the top 500. \n",

The sum of all the possible outcomes of the marginal probability distribution will always be equal to 1. So in our example, what is the likelihood of thrash metal being in the top 500? We can calculate this by dividing the number of thrash metal songs by the total number of songs in the dataset.
