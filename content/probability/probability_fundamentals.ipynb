    "Probability theory is the mathematical framework for reasoning about the random nature of our world. It is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the future, and to make decisions under uncertainty. But what do we mean by \"randomness\"? Maybe we mean that our knowledge of an outcome is incomplete or uncertain. What do we mean by \"probability\"? Maybe we mean subject belief or relative frequency of an event. For example, the probability of a coin landing heads is 0.5. One might argue that this is the case because we know that the coin is fair, or because we have observed that the coin has landed heads 50% of the time. In the first case, this is a case given by a Bayesian, and in the second case, this is a case given by a frequentist. Regardless of the definition, you can still successfully utilize probability theory to make predictions about the future, and to make decisions under uncertainty."

    "  - The **Complement** of a set $A$ is the set of all elements that are not in $A$. This is denoted by $A^c$ (or $\\bar{A}$). For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\{1, 2, 3\\}^c = \\{4, 5, 6, ...\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Subtraction** is defined as the set of all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$. This is denoted by $A - B$ and is equivalent to $A \\cap B^c$. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\{1, 2, 3\\} - \\{3, 4, 5\\} = \\{1, 2\\} $$\n",

    "**Mutually Exclusive** (or disjoint) sets are sets that have no elements in common. For example, $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\{4, 5, 6\\}$ are mutually exclusive. Formally, two sets $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive if $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, where $\\emptyset$ is the empty set, $\\{\\}$.\n",

Countability means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the set and the natural numbers. There are infinite sets which are countable like $\\mathbb{N}$, $\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\mathbb{Q}$. There are also finite sets that are not countable like any interval on the real line, for example, $\\left[0, 1\\right)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The nice thing about cartesian products and cardinality is that the cardinality of a cartesian product is the product of the cardinalities of the sets. For example, the cardinality of $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{4, 5, 6\\}$ is $|A| \\times |B| = 3 \\times 3 = 9$. This is formally defined as:\n",
