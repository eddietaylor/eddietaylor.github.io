    "Probability theory is the mathematical framework for reasoning about the random nature of our world. It is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the future, and to make decisions under uncertainty. But what do we mean by \"randomness\"? Maybe we mean that our knowledge of an outcome is incomplete or uncertain. What do we mean by \"probability\"? Maybe we mean subject belief or relative frequency of an event. For example, the probability of a coin landing heads is 0.5. One might argue that this is the case because we know that the coin is fair, or because we have observed that the coin has landed heads 50% of the time. In the first case, this is a case given by a Bayesian, and in the second case, this is a case given by a frequentist. Regardless of the definition, you can still successfully utilize probability theory to make predictions about the future, and to make decisions under uncertainty."

    "  - **Subtraction** is defined as the set of all elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$. This is denoted by $A - B$ and is equivalent to $A \\cap B^c$. For example,\n",

There are infinite sets which are countable like $\\mathbb{N}$, $\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\mathbb{Q}$. There are also finite sets that are not countable like any interval on the real line, for example, $\\left[0, 1\\right)$.\n",

    "There are five main concepts to get started with thinking of experiments in a probabilistic way:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Experiment**: An experiment is a procedure where we observe the outcome of a random phenomenon, for example the flipping of a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Outcome**: The outcome of an experiment is essentially the result of the experiment. For example, if we flip a coin, the outcome is either heads or tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space of the experiment, which is the universal set of the experiment. For example, if we draw a card from a deck of cards, the sample space is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Trial**: When we start repeating an experiment, we call each one of them a trial. For example, if we flip a coin 10 times, we have 10 trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Event**: An event of an experiment is a collection of possible outcomes. It is a subset of the sample space and this is typically what we're trying to assign a probability to. For example, the event of getting an odd number when we roll a die is the set $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$ and the probability of this event is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
