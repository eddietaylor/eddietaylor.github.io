    "Probability theory is the mathematical framework for reasoning about the random nature of our world. It is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the future, and to make decisions under uncertainty. But what do we mean by \"random\"? Maybe we mean that our knowledge of an outcome is incomplete or uncertain. And what do we mean by \"probability\"? Maybe we mean subjective belief or relative frequency of an event. For example, the probability of a coin landing heads is 0.5. One might argue that this is the case because we know that the coin is fair, or because we have observed that the coin has landed heads 50% of the time. In the first case, it is the perspective given by a Bayesian interpretation of probability, and in the second case, it is the perspective given by a frequentist interpretation of probability. Regardless of your philosophical interpretation of the concepts of \"random\" and \"probability\", you can still successfully utilize probability theory to make predictions about the future, and to make decisions under uncertainty.\n",

    "Let's kick off with some mathematics that will help us understand the logic of probability theory. This will begin with set theory, which is the mathematical framework for reasoning about collections of objects. We will briefly discuss experiments in the probabilistic sense. Then we will introduce the Kolmogorov axioms, which are the axioms that define probability and are the foundations upon which probability theory is built. Finally, we will focus on the key probability measure known as the conditional probability, which is the probability of an event given another event has occurred. This will give us the tools we need to understand the law of total probability, which will then lead us to the Pythagorean theorem of probability: Bayes' Theorem. You should then have a good foundation for proceeding to more advanced topics in probability theory!"

    "As we start doing experiments in the world, we might find that we have already have some information that might impact the probability of certain events. For example, lets say you find yourself in Fairbanks attempting to see the northern lights. Would the fact that it is a cloudy night impact the probability of your seeing the northern lights? Surely it would. We call the probability of an event given some information, the **conditional probability** of the event. The conditional probability of an event $A$ given some information $B$ is denoted by $P(A|B)$. It is helpful to first build intuition for this concept by looking at the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Suppose you you're interested in the event of getting an even number when you roll a die. Now suppose the die is rolled but before seeing the result, you're told that the number is less than or equal to 3. What is the probability that you rolled an even number? In this example, $A$ is the event of getting an even number and $B$ is the event of getting a number less than or equal to 3 and we want to estimate $P(A|B)$. The intuition here is that we are now in the space of $B$, aka the space of numbers less than or equal to 3. So by our definition above, we can just count the number of even numbers in this space and divide by the number of elements in the space. In this case, there is one even number in the space, 2, and there are 3 elements in the space, so the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. What we actually did in the numberator is count the number of outcomes in $A$ that are also in $B$, aka the intersection of the two. Formally, we solved this problem by using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|B|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then divide both numerator and denominator by the count of the sample space and rewrite this formula as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{\\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|S|}}{\\frac{|B|}{|S|}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to see that for disjoint events, $P(A \\cap B) = 0$ and so $P(A|B) = 0$. This is because if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then there are no outcomes in $A$ that are also in $B$. Also, If $B$ is a subset of $A$, then $P(A \\cap B) = P(B)$ and so $P(A|B) = 1$. This is because if $B$ is a subset of $A$, then all outcomes in $B$ are also in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability also satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms of probability. For example, if you have a set of mutually exclusive events $A_1, A_2, A_3, ...$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i|B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(A_i|B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the useful formulas from before also hold for conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A - B|C) = P(A|C) - P(A \\cap B|C) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cup B|C) = P(A|C) + P(B|C) - P(A \\cap B|C) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A^c|B) = 1 - P(A|B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, one additional formula follows from a basic rearranging of the equation for conditional probability and it is known as the **Chain Rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and in general for any number of events:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3 \\cap ... \\cap A_n) = P(A_1)P(A_2|A_1)P(A_3|A_1 \\cap A_2) ... P(A_n|A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap ... \\cap A_{n-1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets look at a key concept known as **Independence**. Essentially, two events are independent if the probability of one event does not change when we know the outcome of the other event. Note, that this is not the same as saying that the two events are disjoint or that they cannot occur simultaneously. For example, given the event $B$ that a human has blue eyes, what are the odds of the event $A$ that it has a brother? There are many people with blue eyes who have brothers, so the two events are not disjoint. However, the probability of having a brother is independent of the fact that you have blue eyes. So basically we're saying $B$ does not impact the probability of $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = P(A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does this imply given our equation for conditional probability? Well, we can use the chain rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we know that $P(A|B) = P(A)$ so we can substitute this into the equation above and get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is a necessary and sufficient condition for independence (they're equivalent). In other words, when events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities together to get the probability of the intersection of the two events. Furthermore, it also means that the probability of one event given the other independent event is the the same as the prior probability of the event ($ P(A|B) = P(A) $).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more than two events, independence is true if and only if all of the events are pairwise independent in addition to simulatenously independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, independence tells us that the probability of the union of two independent events is related to their complements:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cup B) = 1 - P(A^c)P(B^c) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind that **if two events are disjoint, then they are dependent**, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = 0 => P(A|B) = 0 \\neq P(A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So knowing $B$ tells you that $A$ did not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful tool that conditional probability gives us is the **Law of Total Probability**. Consider an event $B$. $B$ and $B^c$ form a partition of the sample space. Now consider an event $A$. It's trivial to show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A) = P(A\\cap B) + P(A\\cap B^c) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ => P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B^c)P(B^c) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This then generalizes to any number of events:\n",

    "$$ P(A) = \\sum_{i=1} P(A\\cap B_i) = \\sum_{i=1} P(A|B_i)P(B_i) $$\n",

Many times, you don't know the denominator $P(A)$, but you know its occurence under several disjoint events $B_1, B_2, B_3, ...$ so one can use the law of total probability to give the alternative form of Bayes' rule that is often used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(B_i|A) = \\frac{P(A|B_i)P(B_i)}{\\sum_{i=1} P(A|B_i)P(B_i)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also used to update the probability of an event given new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical example typically used is test results for an unlikely disease. For example, suppose that the probability of having the disease is 0.01% and the probability of a positive test result given that you have the disease is 98%. The probability that the test result is negative given that you have the disease is 2%. What is the probability that you have the disease given that you have a positive test result? We can use Bayes' rule to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $D$ is the event that you have the disease and $T$ is the event that you have a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator, $P(T)$, is the probability of a positive test result. We can use the law of total probability to find this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $D^c$ is the complement of the event $D$ (i.e. the event that you do not have the disease). We know that $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D)$ and $P(T^c|D) = 1 - P(T|D)$ so we can simplify the equation above to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + (1 - P(T|D))(1 - P(D)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.0001}{0.98 \\times 0.0001 + 0.02 \\times 0.9999} = 0.0049 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the probability that you have the disease given that you have a positive test result is 0.49%. This is surprising to our intuition given that the test result is quite accurate given you have the illness. But you have to keep in mind that the disease is also quite rare. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the context of **Bayesian inference**, Bayes' rule is used to update the **prior** probability of an event given new information. Looking at Bayes' rule again:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the language of Bayesian inference, $P(B|A)$ is the **posterior** probability of event $B$ given event $A$. $P(A|B)$ is the **likelihood** of event $A$ given event $B$. $P(B)$ is the **prior** probability of event $B$. $P(A)$ is the **marginal probability** of event $A$."

    "In this article, we started from set theory and spoke about concepts such as unions, intersections, complements, partitions, mutual exclusivity, and cardinality. We then used this framework to define experiments, events, and sample spaces. We then axiomatically defined probability through the Kolmogorov axioms of probability and then dove into the important concepts of independence and conditional probability. We then derived Bayes' theorem and used it to solve a simple example. These are the fundamental concepts of probability theory and are used in many areas of machine learning and science and now you know them!"
