title: More About Author
👋 Hi, I’m Eddie Taylor! My background is in physics and I finished my PhD in experimental plasma physics in 2019. I currently work as a pricing operations research analyst and have three years experience in revene management problems.

👀 With regards to data science, I’m interested in anomaly detection, time series forecasting, numerical optimization, stochastic modelling and generalized linear models. With regards to science, I'm interested in all of the social sciences and humanities. 

🌱 I’m currently learning nonparametric regression techniques, two staged regression, double machine learning and demand estimation!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on demand estimation modelling in the context of retail, airline, hotel or rental car problems. In addition, any problems in the algorithmic trading space and extracting alpha using ML and statistical modelling techniques!
